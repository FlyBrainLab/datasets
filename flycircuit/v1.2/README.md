#### 06/09/2022: Update according to NeuroArch 0.4.0
Rmoved duplicate inferred connections, the number of connections reduced to 3,596,493.

#### 12/17/2020: Initial release.
Includes 22,828 neurons from female *Drosophila* from the FlyCircuit dataset [[1]](#ref-1).
Also incudes a total of 4,538,280 inferred connections [[2]](ref-2) between pairs of neurons.
