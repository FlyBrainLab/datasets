# Larva L1EM
Connectomics data from the Larva L1EM Central Nervous System is provided publically by CATMAID database served on [Virtual Fly Brain](https://l1em.catmaid.virtualflybrain.org). 

### Set Up
Refer to `l1em/Load_Larva_L1EM.ipynb` for information on loading the dataset into a locally running OrientDB database instance.
Alternatively, you can also refer to `l1em/Load_Larva_L1EM.py` and the command line interface defined therein.

Before you move forward, you will need to download the SWC files and place it in `l1em` folder (with path `l1em/swc`).
